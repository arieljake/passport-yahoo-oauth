# Passport-Yahoo-OAuth

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategies for authenticating with [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com/)
using the OAuth 1.0a API.

This module has been totally dismantled to work with Yahoo! and its many documented OAuth travesties.
There are no external dependencies to passport or oauth libs as they have left this library in the dust.
Everything needed to communicate with Yahoo! using OAuth v1 has been brought into this module.
